					<h2><a href="bingo.html">bingo</a></h2>
					<p>
						At <strong>Hands On Academy</strong>, we pride ourselves on
						fostering an environment where students transform into adept
						communicators. By creating a safe and friendly ambiance, students
						feel at ease to openly share their thoughts and perspectives. We
						emphasize teamwork, encouraging active participation from every
						individual. Through tailored activities, students hone their skills
						as active listeners. Importantly, instead of directly pointing out
						errors, we believe in guiding students with constructive feedback,
						empowering them to recognize and correct their own mistakes. This
						nurturing approach not only builds their competence but also boosts
						their confidence.
